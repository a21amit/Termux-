Deletion of directory

1. [rm -d directory]
"Providing more than one directory name deletes
 all of the specified empty directories."

2. [rm -d directory1 directory2 /path/to/directory3]
"To delete directories that are not empty,
 use the -r (recursive) option.
 To be clear, this removes the directories
 and all files and sub-directories contained
 within them."

3.[rm -r directory1 directory2 directory3]
 "If a directory or a file is write-protected,
  you will be prompted to confirm the deletion. 
  To delete directories that are not empty and 
  to suppress these prompts, use the -r (recursive)
  and -f (force) options together."

4.[rm -rf directory]
 "Care is required here. Making a mistake with
  the rm -rf command could cause data loss or
  system malfunction."
